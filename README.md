This is some fun coding

just to keep me thinking procedurally after all the prolog

and to have some practice not putting a full stop after

each line of code.

I am following coding challenge 3 from Daniel Shiffman

from the coding train.  But I am updating it to use Classes

and switch cases, as well a some other small changes

I stated coding on replit and even created this github repo

there. watching youtube in the browser and running replit in 

the browser was making my computer hot and laggy not to mention

some disruptions from my vpn (coding in Beijing)

so now am continuing in vs Code.
